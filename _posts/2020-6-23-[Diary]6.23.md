## Problems

### Some problems when learning algebraic topology

1.在covering space部分，什么叫Y满足path connected和locally path connected？

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/135463/path-connectedness-and-locally-path-connected

2.groupoid

参考nlba和wiki

### Some problems when learning fibre bundles

1.closed和compact with boundary的区别

2.什么时候vector space能被视为manifold？

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1645141/when-is-a-manifold-also-a-vector-space

回答中只有一部分。我还想问：

complex vector space可以被视为manifold吗，毕竟我们研究的Hilbert space里都是这种，不过Hilbert space是CPn，从wiki上说是complex manifold...

其次是infinite vector space可以被视为manifold吗...听起来就离谱。

3.nakahara书上example9.7给出了classification of U(1)的情况，那么对于SU(2)时principal fibre是nontrivial的吗？毕竟pi_2(SU(2))是trivial的...

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/195592/classification-of-su2-principal-fibre-bundles-over-four-dimensional-manifold

https://mathoverflow.net/questions/199781/classification-of-su2-bundles-versus-the-classification-of-so3-bundles

其实example 9.8给出了进一步的SU(2)的情况，可以参考。

### Some notes when learning connections on fibre bundles

1.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics)

In Ehresmann's point of view, a connection in a principal bundle consists of a specification of horizontal and vertical vector fields on the total space of the bundle. A parallel translation is then a lifting of a curve from the base to a curve in the principal bundle which is horizontal. 

2.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_(mathematics)

i)Using principal bundles, a connection can be realized as a Lie algebra-valued differential form. See connection (principal bundle).

ii)An approach to connections which makes direct use of the notion of transport of "data" (whatever that may be) is the Ehresmann connection.

iii)The most abstract approach may be that suggested by Alexander Grothendieck, where a Grothendieck connection is seen as descent data from infinitesimal neighbourhoods of the diagonal; see (Osserman 2004).

introduction部分说的挺有逻辑的
